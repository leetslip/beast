# Frontend README for Beast Terminal

# Beast Terminal Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Beast Terminal project, built using React. It serves as the user interface for interacting with the backend server and the Discord bot.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd beast-terminal/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: The main component of the application.
  - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application.
  
- `public/`: Contains static files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file for the React application.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` folder with optimized files for deployment.
